- Phase: 1 (MVP Complete!)
- Status: LIVE and FUNCTIONAL - Frontend on GitHub Pages + API on Render
- Completed today (2025-09-01):
  - Wired parser into main.py with OCR integration ✅
  - Built complete React frontend (Dashboard + Capture) ✅  
  - Deployed live frontend on GitHub Pages ✅
  - Fixed OCR.space integration with image compression ✅
  - End-to-end workflow: Upload → OCR → Parse → Store → Display ✅
- Live URLs:
  - Frontend: https://garybary.github.io/ExpenseTracker/
  - API: https://expense-tracker-api-23b3.onrender.com
- Next (Phase 2):
  - UX improvements (manual corrections, better categories)
  - Enhanced parsing for different receipt formats
  - CSV export functionality
- Risks:
  - OCR accuracy varies by receipt quality; free-tier usage limits
