- Phase: 0
- Status: API deployed on Render; DB connected (External URL); schema isolation via `DB_SCHEMA=et`
- Completed today:
  - Repo scaffolded with FastAPI API
  - Render Blueprint deployed; fixed driver (`postgresql+psycopg`) and DB URL
  - Created schema-aware setup; verified via Swagger `/docs` and `/stats/fy`
  - Added OCR parsing module `api/app/utils/parse_receipt.py`
- Next:
  - Wire parser into `api/app/main.py` to auto-fill fields from OCR
  - Redeploy API
  - Scaffold `frontend/` (camera/upload + dashboard) and set up GitHub Pages
- Risks:
  - OCR accuracy variability; free-tier DB limits
