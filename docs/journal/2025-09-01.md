- **MAJOR MILESTONE**: ExpenseTracker is now live and fully functional!
- Integrated receipt parser into main.py with automatic OCR text extraction
- Built complete React frontend, then switched to static HTML to avoid Node.js issues
- Deployed frontend on GitHub Pages (bypassed complex GitHub Actions problems)
- Fixed OCR.space integration: added image compression (Pillow) and proper error handling
- Connected frontend to live Render API with CORS configuration
- End-to-end test successful: receipt upload → OCR processing → data parsing → dashboard display
- Technical win: Static HTML proved more reliable than React build pipeline
- Phase 1 MVP essentially complete - users can now track expenses with automated receipt processing
